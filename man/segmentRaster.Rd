\description{
Segmentation of a raster object using k-means clustering and connected component labeling.
}
\details{
{The function clusters a raster object with k-means through \link[RStoolbox]{unsuperClass} and segments the output using
\link[fieldRS]{ccLabel}. The number of samples used to determine the number of clusters can be defined through \emph{n.size} to reduce
the required computational time. The optimal number of clusters is determined with the elbow method. he elbow method looks at the
percentage of variance explained by the number of clusters. If adding a new cluster, referred here as k, leads to no improvement,
the function will use k-1 to derive. This breakpoint is determined by \emph{change.threshold} which controls the percent change
between the amount of variance explained by two consequent k values. the output is a list consisting of:
 \itemize{
 \item{\emph{class} - Cluster image.}
 \item{\emph{regions} - Segmented region image.}}}
